Section 1: Dataset Exploration

We began our project by performing an initial exploration of the dataset. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, along with a binary target variable.
Key Steps:

    Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure.

    Identified numerical and categorical columns.

    Described the distribution of numerical features using histograms and boxplots.

    Visualized correlations between numerical variables using a heatmap.

Observations:

    Some features exhibited skewed distributions and extreme outliers.

    Several numerical features showed strong correlations with one another.

    Scatterplots helped identify possible linear relationships.




Section 2: Data Preprocessing

We cleaned the dataset to improve quality and prepare it for modeling.
Key Steps:

    Missing values were handled using:

        Mean/constant imputation for numerical data.

        Most frequent imputation for categorical data.

    Outliers were detected and removed using the IQR method.

    Categorical variables were encoded using One-Hot Encoding.

    Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler.

    A complete preprocessing pipeline was built using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline.

Result:

    A clean, transformed dataset, ready for modeling.

    Normalized numerical features (mean = 0, std = 1).

    Preprocessed training and test sets: X_train_prepared and X_test_prepared.



Section 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We conducted a deeper exploration of the cleaned dataset to understand which features are most relevant to the target variable.
1. 📊 Distribution Analysis

    Post-cleaning boxplots showed improved, compact distributions, confirming the successful removal of outliers.

2. 📈 Target Distribution

    The target variable is binary and moderately balanced.

3. 📐 Correlation Analysis

    Numerical features like feature_1 to feature_4 showed high mutual correlation.

    A correlation heatmap was used to visualize dependencies.

4. 📤 T-Test (Numerical Features)

To test for significant differences between the two target classes:

    ✅ Significant relationship: feature_1, feature_2, feature_3, feature_4

    🚫 No significant relationship: feature_5, feature_6, feature_7, feature_8

5. 🧮 Chi-Square Test (Categorical Features)

To test for independence between categorical variables and the target:

    ✅ Significant: category_1

    🚫 Not significant: category_2

✅ Current State:
We now have a cleaned, transformed dataset and have identified key features for modeling. We're ready to proceed to:



📘 Section 4 – Feature Engineering
Objective:

Enhance model performance by generating or selecting features that better represent the underlying data patterns.
Actions Taken:

    Feature Reduction:

        Based on the correlation matrix, feature_2 showed very high correlation (r ≈ 1) with feature_1.

        As such, feature_2 was removed to reduce multicollinearity and avoid model overfitting.

    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (optional step):

        PCA was tested on the numerical features to evaluate dimensionality reduction.

        It revealed that the first component explained the majority of variance across 3 correlated features.

        However, the decision to drop features was primarily based on correlation to keep interpretability.

    Preserving Categorical Features:

        Categorical features (category_1, category_2) were not modified directly.

        They were encoded later using OneHotEncoder inside the preprocessing pipeline.

Section 6: Hyperparameter Tuning
Objective

The goal of this section is to improve model performance through hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV. We focus on the three best-performing models based on previous ROC AUC results: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Approach

We used GridSearchCV from sklearn.model_selection with 5-fold StratifiedKFold cross-validation to find the best set of hyperparameters for each model. The models were embedded in pipelines that include preprocessing steps (imputation, encoding, scaling).
Hyperparameter Grids

    Logistic Regression

        C: [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]

        penalty: ['l2']

        solver: ['lbfgs']

    Random Forest

        n_estimators: [100, 200]

        max_depth: [None, 10, 20]

        min_samples_split: [2, 5]

    Gradient Boosting

        n_estimators: [100, 200]

        learning_rate: [0.01, 0.1, 0.2]

        max_depth: [3, 5]

Best Parameters and Scores
Model	Best ROC AUC	Best Parameters
Logistic Regression	0.9572	{'C': 1, 'penalty': 'l2', 'solver': 'lbfgs'}
Gradient Boosting	0.9559	{'learning_rate': 0.1, 'max_depth': 3, 'n_estimators': 200}
Random Forest	0.9544	{'max_depth': 10, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 200}
Performance Comparison

We compared ROC AUC scores before and after tuning. All tuned models showed slight improvements in performance, confirming the benefit of hyperparameter optimization.

    📈 Logistic Regression remained the best-performing model after tuning, with a ROC AUC of 0.9572.

Conclusion

Hyperparameter tuning using grid search improved the overall performance of the selected models. These optimized models will be used in the subsequent analysis and interpretation stages.




7. Discuss how the insights align with domain knowledge and business logic

The insights gained from feature importance analysis and SHAP values provide meaningful alignment with domain knowledge and business logic. Below are the main takeaways:
1. Dominance of feature_1

Across all models, feature_1 consistently shows the highest predictive importance:

    In Gradient Boosting, it demonstrates a significant gap between itself and all other features, indicating that the model heavily relies on it to make accurate predictions.

    In Random Forest, while feature_1 remains the most important, the importance is more evenly distributed across features, especially with feature_4 taking on a more prominent role.

    SHAP analysis further confirms this dominance — the SHAP values associated with feature_1 are among the highest in magnitude and most consistent in directionality.

Business alignment:
If feature_1 represents a critical behavioral, financial, or demographic attribute (e.g., customer transaction amount, credit utilization, or tenure), its dominance is well-aligned with expectations in tasks such as credit scoring, customer churn, or risk prediction.
2. Supporting Role of feature_4

    In the absence of feature_1, models begin to rely more heavily on feature_4, as evidenced by its increased importance and SHAP contributions.

    This indicates that feature_4 may act as a secondary signal that can partially compensate when the primary feature is unavailable.

Business alignment:
From a practical standpoint, feature_4 could be used as a fallback or part of a simplified model in situations where data collection for feature_1 is limited or delayed.
3. Observations from PCA Component

    feature_6_7_8_pca was engineered using PCA due to strong multicollinearity observed among feature_6, feature_7, and feature_8.

    While this PCA feature ranks lowest in importance in all models, its inclusion helps mitigate redundancy and potential noise.

    The SHAP values also show it contributes minimally to individual predictions.

Business logic implication:
While not strongly predictive, feature_6_7_8_pca provides structural soundness to the dataset by addressing correlation and ensuring model generalizability.
4. Correlation and Redundancy Handling

    The correlation matrix showed that feature_1 and feature_2 have very high similarity, and feature_1 also shares moderate correlation with feature_4.

    These were not transformed via PCA to preserve interpretability. Instead, Logistic Regression with regularization handled this via coefficient shrinkage.

    In contrast, highly correlated features (6, 7, 8) were reduced using PCA.

Business logic alignment:
This hybrid approach — regularization for moderate correlation, PCA for high multicollinearity — balances interpretability with model robustness, which is critical in real-world scenarios where explainability is essential (e.g., financial risk models).
5. SHAP Interpretability Insights

    SHAP values show that high or low values of feature_1 strongly push the model output in one direction, validating its predictive power.

    feature_4 also demonstrates clear SHAP value patterns, adding confidence in its inclusion.

    Other features show weaker, noisier SHAP contributions, which aligns with their lower overall importance.

Interpretability value:
SHAP analysis allows for individual-level explanations, making the model more transparent for stakeholders, especially in regulated domains.
6. Risks and Recommendations

    The model's heavy reliance on feature_1 is both a strength and a risk. If this feature becomes unstable or suffers from data drift, the model performance could degrade rapidly.

    There is a potential risk of over-reliance on a single predictor, which may lead to biased or brittle models.

Recommendations:

    Monitor feature_1 for data drift and distribution shifts in production.

    Regularly retrain models and assess feature stability.

    Consider using ensemble approaches or feature engineering to diversify model reliance.

    Keep feature_4 and similar features as potential backup signals for robustness.

✅ Conclusion

The insights derived from model interpretation are consistent with what would be expected based on sound domain and business understanding. The combination of importance rankings, SHAP values, and correlation analysis supports the validity, transparency, and practical utility of the models. These interpretations not only confirm model behavior but also guide real-world implementation strategies and risk management.
